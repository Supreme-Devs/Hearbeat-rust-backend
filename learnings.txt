// for taking input from the user in any endpoint we need to use serde for serialization and deserialization
// json is not the first class citizen in rust

// we write the structs and then we use the structures for input and output in json format


for using the library store 

add store as a dependency in the api/cargo.toml
and in the file where you want to use the store 
use store::Store;
